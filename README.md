# RGB-Heaven
This repository is a way to enable ourselves to create, edit, alter, and re-invent RGB so we can use it how ever we want!
I created this repository to compile an exsiting repository called RGBSync+. I hope this readme will do because there isn't much else to say about it!
(An example of an edit within the second branch to create new information as a guide to understand how to add branches and new information related to alterations of the code or changes to the information previously thought to be all knowlage of the code.)
